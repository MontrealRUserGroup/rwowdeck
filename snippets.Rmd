## Some Math

Let us now try out some Math.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\alpha & = \beta + \gamma \\
\gamma & = \sum x_i + y_i
\end{aligned}
$$

```{r eval = F}
install_github('knitr', 'yihui')
install_github('whisker', 'edwindj')
install_github('markdown', 'rstudio')
```

### Usage

`slidify` is designed to make it very easy for a HTML novice to generate a crisp, visually appealing `HTML5` slide deck. You can do it in just three steps!

* Write your source file in [R Markdown](http://goo.gl/KKdaf)
* Separate your slides using a horizontal rule `---`
* Run `slidify("slides.Rmd")` to generate your slide deck.

---
`slidify` allows you to render your slides using several HTML5 slide frameworks. Currently supported frameworks are:

* [deck.js][1]
* [dzslides][2]
* [html5slides][3]
* [shower][4]
* [slidy][5]

Extending `slidify` to accommodate other frameworks is pretty straightforward. The plan is to support more frameworks over time.
